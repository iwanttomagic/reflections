What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository git creates a git repository for all the files in your repository. You
need to do this in order to save commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?
The staging area is a place where you can gather up files to add to a commit. It only holds one version
each file, unlike the the repository. It only holds the files you wish to commit, unlike the directory.
