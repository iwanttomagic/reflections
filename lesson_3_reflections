When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you wanted to share your project, or if you weren't the only one working on a  project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date withyour remote
repository?
You would want to pull changes manually because then your commits would make the most logical sense. Leaving git to pull changes
will give you arbitrary commits--they might be too big or too small.
